- 👋 Hi, I’m @jonjon-el
- 👀 I’m interested in quantum physics, electromagnetic theory, fluid dynamics, electronics, modeling with differential equations, numeric calculations and simulation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dynamical pictures of quantum mechanics and using computer to perform this calculations. Also, learning to develop programs in LCL with Free pascal, Qt/c++, pySide and kivy with python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing applications that needs to perform calculations to predict behavior, follow rules and guidelines, and simulation.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Writing to nelsonsandovalpuente@gmail.com.
